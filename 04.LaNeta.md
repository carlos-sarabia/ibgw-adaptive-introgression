# Timing of dog introgression 

We are calculating time since introgression using LaNeta (Liang et al. 2022, PlosGen - https://github.com/hse-cs/LaNeta). 
To do this, we will need the recombination map from Auton et al. (2013, PlosGen)
merged,autosomes.vcf.gz contains IBGW (32 individuals), NEGW (30 individuals) and DOG (31 individuals)

```
in=/path_to_phased_pops
recom=/path_to_recomb_rate_files

for i in {01..38}; do cat $recom/chr$i.recom_rate; done > $recom/recomb_rate.txt

python3.9 $laneta -b 0.01 -vcf $in/merged.autosomes.vcf.gz -p popfile -m $recom/recomb_rate.txt -p0 IBGW -p1 NEGW -p2 DOG -jk -mt 0.05
```
